# NFL-QBR-Tracker

## Overview
My project is very similar to the high score tracker, except it tracks NFL QBR's over the past 5 years. The user will first input a year between 2015 and 2020 and the output will ask to choose a starting QB from that year. Then the user will next put in a starting QB from that year and it will output the QBR of that QB from that year. If the user puts in a a player that is not a starting QB or inputs a mistake in writing the QB's name then the system will output a "That is not a starting QB from ..." the "..." represents the year. Also if they put a year not in the algorithm or a random word when answering the "Enter a year between 2015 and 2020" question it will output "Please select a year between 2015 and 2020".
